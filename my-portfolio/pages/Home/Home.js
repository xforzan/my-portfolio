    <h1>Achraf Nakhil</h1>
    <p>I'm a software engineer based in Toronto, 
    Canada and also a communication and journalism student. 
    I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, 
    whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. 
    I have been freelancing for a year now while studying at the university and 
    I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and valuable knowledge 
    from all different kinds of fields throughout my projects/work.</p>
